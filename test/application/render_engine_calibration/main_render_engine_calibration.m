%% RADIOMETRIC CALIBRATION OF RENDER ENGINES
% Render a 1m-radius, 0.01 albedo, Lambertian sphere placed at 1 AU of distance from the 
% Sun and different phase angles and at a common exposure time such to
% avoid saturation.
% Then perform the calibration comparing the electron count of
% ABRAM vs the one expected by the image.
% Note that the calibration has to be performed every time the camera changes
% in terms of parameters that the render engine does not model (e.g. the
% pupil diameter or the quantum efficiency in Blender)
